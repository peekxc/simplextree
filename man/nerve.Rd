\title{Nerve of a cover}
\usage{
nerve(st, cover, k = st$dimension, threshold = 1L, neighborhood = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{st}{a simplex tree.}

\item{cover}{list of integers indicating set membership. See details.}

\item{k}{max simplex dimension to consider.}

\item{threshold}{the number of elements in common for \code{k} sets to be considered intersecting. Defaults to 1.}

\item{neighborhood}{which combinations of sets to check. See details.}
}
\value{
a simplicial complex (object of class \code{"Rcpp_SimplexTree"}).
}
\description{
Compute the nerve of a given cover.
}
\details{
This computes the nerve of a given cover, adding a \eqn{k}-simplex for each combination of \eqn{k+1} sets
in the given \code{cover} that have at least \code{threshold} elements in their common intersection.

If \code{neighborhood} is supplied, it can be either (1) a matrix, (2) a list, or (3) a function. Each
type parameterizes which sets in the cover need be checked for to see if they have at least \code{threshold}
elements in their common intersection. If a matrix is supplied, the columns should indicate the indices
of the cover to check (e.g if \code{neighborhood = matrix(c(1,2), nrow = 2)}, then only the first two sets of \code{cover}
are tested.). Similarly, if a list is supplied, each element in the list should give the indices to test.

The most flexible option is supplying a function to \code{neighborhood}. If a function is passed, it's assumed to
accept an integer vector of \eqn{k} indices (of the cover) and return a boolean indicating whether or not to
\emph{test} if they have at least \code{threshold} elements in their common intersection. This can be used
to filter out subsets of the cover the user knows are  The indices are
generated using the same code that performs \code{\link[=expand]{expand()}}.
