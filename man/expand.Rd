\usage{
expand(st, k = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{st}{a simplex tree.}

\item{k}{the target dimension of the expansion.}
}
\value{
the expanded simplex tree \code{st}, invisibly.
}
\description{
Performs a \eqn{k}-expansion on the 1-skeleton of the complex, adding \eqn{k}-simplices
if all combinations of edges are included. Because this operation uses the edges alone to infer
the existence of higher order simplices, the expansion assumes the underlying complex
is a flag complex.
