\description{
Creates a filtration of flag complexes

Creates a filtration of flag complexes
}
\details{
A flag complex is a simplicial complex whose \eqn{k}-simplices for \eqn{k >= 2} are completely determined
by edges/graph of the complex. This function creates filtered simplicial complex using the supplied edge
weights. The resulting complex is a simplex tree object endowed with additional structure; see.
Vertices have their weights set to 0, and \eqn{k}-simplices w/ \eqn{k >= 2} have their weights set to the maximum
weight of any of its edges.
