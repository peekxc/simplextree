\title{Insert simplices}
\usage{
insert(st, simplices)
}
\arguments{
\item{st}{a simplex tree.}

\item{simplices}{simplices to insert, either as a vector, a list of vectors, or a column-matrix. See details.}
}
\value{
the simplex tree \code{st} with the simplices \code{simplices} inserted, invisibly.
}
\description{
Inserts simplices into the simplex tree. Individual simplices are specified as vectors, and a set of simplices as a list of vectors.
}
\details{
This function allows insertion of arbitrary order simplices. If the simplex already exists in the tree,
no insertion is made, and the tree is not modified. \code{simplices} is sorted before traversing the trie.
Faces of \code{simplices} not in the simplex tree are inserted as needed.

If \code{simplices} is a vector, it's assumed to be a simplex. If a list, its assumed each element in the list
represents a simplex (as vectors). If the simplices to insert are all of the same dimension, you can also
optionally use a matrix, where each column is assumed to be a simplex.

\examples{
st <- simplex_tree()
st \%>\% insert(1:3) ## inserts the 2-simplex { 1, 2, 3 }
st \%>\% insert(list(4:5, 6)) ## inserts a 1-simplex { 4, 5 } and a 0-simplex { 6 }.
st \%>\% insert(combn(5,3)) ## inserts all the 2-faces of a 4-simplex
