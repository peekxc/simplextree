\title{Edge contraction}
\usage{
contract(st, edge)
}
\arguments{
\item{st}{a simplex tree.}

\item{edge}{an edge to contract, as a 2-length vector.}
}
\value{
the contracted simplex tree \code{st}, invisibly.
}
\description{
Performs an edge contraction.
}
\details{
This function performs an \emph{edge contraction} in the sense described by (1), which is
summarized here. Given an edge \eqn{(v,w)}, \eqn{w} is contracted to \eqn{v} if \eqn{w} is
removed from the complex and the link of \eqn{v} is augmented with the link of \eqn{w}. This may be thought as
applying the mapping:

\deqn{f(u) = v}

if \eqn{u = w}
and identity otherwise, to all simplices in the complex.

\code{edge} is \strong{not} sorted prior to contraction: the second vertex of the edge is always contracted to the first.
Note that edge contraction is not symmetric.
