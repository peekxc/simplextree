\description{
Prints a traversal, a simplex tree, or a list of simplices to the R console, with
options to customize how the simplices are printed. The \code{format} must be one of
"summary", "tree", "cousins", "short", "column", or "row", with the default being "short".
In general, the "tree" and "cousins" format give more details on the structure of the trie,
whereas the other formats just change how the given set of simplices are formatted.

The "tree" method prints the nodes grouped by the same last label and indexed by depth.
The printed format is:

\code{[vertex] (h = [subtree height]): [subtree depth]([subtree])}

Where each lists the top node (\emph{vertex}) and its corresponding subtree. The
\emph{subtree height} displays the highest order \eqn{k}-simplex in that subtree. Each
level in the subtree tree is a set of sibling \eqn{k}-simplices whose order is given
by the number of dots (\code{'.'}) proceeding the print level.

The "cousin" format prints the simplex relations used by various algorithms to speed
up finding adjacencies in the complex. The cousins are grouped by label and depth.

The format looks like:

\code{(last=[label], depth=[depth of label]): [simplex]}

This function is useful for understanding how the simplex tree is stored, and for debugging purposes.
