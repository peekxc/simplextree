\title{Remove simplices}
\usage{
remove(st, simplices)
}
\arguments{
\item{st}{a simplex tree.}

\item{simplices}{simplices to insert, either as a vector, a list of vectors, or a column-matrix. See details.}
}
\value{
the simplex tree \code{st} with the simplices \code{simplices} removed, invisibly.
}
\description{
Removes simplices from the simplex tree. Individual simplices are specified as vectors, and a set of simplices as a list of vectors.
}
\details{
This function allows removal of a arbitrary order simplices. If \code{simplices} already exists in the tree,
it is removed, otherwise the tree is not modified. \code{simplices} is sorted before traversing the trie.
Cofaces of \code{simplices} are also removed.

If \code{simplices} is a vector, it's assumed to be a simplex. If a list, its assumed each element in the list
represents a simplex (as vectors). If the simplices to insert are all of the same dimension, you can also
optionally use a matrix, where each column is assumed to be a simplex.
