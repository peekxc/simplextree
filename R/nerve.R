#' @title Nerve of a cover
#' @description Compute the nerve of a given cover.
#' @param st a simplex tree.
#' @param cover list of integers indicating set membership. See details. 
#' @param k max simplex dimension to consider. 
#' @param threshold the number of elements in common for `k` sets to be considered intersecting. Defaults to 1. 
#' @param neighborhood which combinations of sets to check. See details. 
#' @return a simplicial complex (object of class `"Rcpp_SimplexTree"`).
#' @details This computes the nerve of a given cover, adding a \eqn{k}-simplex for each combination of \eqn{k+1} sets 
#' in the given `cover` that have at least `threshold` elements in their common intersection.
#' 
#' If `neighborhood` is supplied, it can be either (1) a matrix, (2) a list, or (3) a function. Each 
#' type parameterizes which sets in the cover need be checked for to see if they have at least `threshold`
#' elements in their common intersection. If a matrix is supplied, the columns should indicate the indices 
#' of the cover to check (e.g if `neighborhood = matrix(c(1,2), nrow = 2)`, then only the first two sets of `cover`
#' are tested.). Similarly, if a list is supplied, each element in the list should give the indices to test.
#' 
#' The most flexible option is supplying a function to `neighborhood`. If a function is passed, it's assumed to 
#' accept an integer vector of \eqn{k} indices (of the cover) and return a boolean indicating whether or not to 
#' _test_ if they have at least `threshold` elements in their common intersection. This can be used
#' to filter out subsets of the cover the user knows are  The indices are 
#' generated using the same code that performs [expand()].
